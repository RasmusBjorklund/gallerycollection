          <p>Gallery Collection is just what it sounds like.
            The ultimate hub for all types of photographs, from all over the world.
            You simply just create an account, create a post and share it with everyone!
            You have the ability to edit, view and delete you own posts, ofcourse.
            But you can also explore all of the existing posts, shared from all of the other photographs!
            Even if you dont have an account!
